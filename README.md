# WordLoom
WordLoom is a browser-based crossword generator for rapid puzzle prototyping. Paste a word list and it weaves a compact, square-ish grid using multi-start heuristics and local hill-climbing. Live preview, show/hide solution, PNG export, and seed/restarts for reproducibility. Mobile-friendly and runs entirely offline; no data leaves your browser.
